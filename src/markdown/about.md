I came across Josh Comeau's blog awhile back and was quickly a big fan of his many articles.

Will take the Gatsby #SillySiteChallenge as an opportunity implement his many best practices.

### Goals

- [x] [Hover Animations](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/)

  - **Learnings:**
  <ol>
    <li> Abstracting animations into individual components </li>
    <li> Using React-Spring for animations</li>
    <li> Decoupling the animation trigger area and animation area of the component with custom hooks </li>
    <li>Accessible Animations, reduced motion and how to disable them. (Not applied to this site due to gatsby implications) </li>
  </ol>

- [ ] use a component library for quick styling
- [ ] [UseSound](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/)
- [ ] [Toggling between light and dark mode](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/)
