I came across Josh Comeau's blog awhile back and was quickly a big fan of his many articles.

Will take the Gatsby #SillySiteChallenge as an opportunity to walk through his articles!

### Goals

- [x] [Hover Animations](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/boop/)
- [ ] [UseSound](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/announcing-use-sound-react-hook/)
- [ ] [Toggling between light and dark mode](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/)

Things I've learnt:

1. Abstracting animations into individual components
2. Using React-Spring for animations
3. Decoupling the animation trigger area and animation area of the component with custom hooks
4. Accessible Animations, reduced motion and how to disable them. (Not applied to this site due to gatsby implications)
